```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins <- penguins
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x= flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) + 
  labs(title = "Flipper Length and Body Mass by Species",
       subtitle = "Palmer Penguins",
       x = "Flipper Length (mm)",
       y = "Body Mass (g)",
       color = "Species") +
  theme_gray()
```

This scatterplot shows a positive correlation between penguin flipper length and body mass. While the Adelie and Chinstrap species are similar in size, the Gentoos weigh a lot more and have much longer flippers.
